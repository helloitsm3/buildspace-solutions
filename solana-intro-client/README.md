## Solana Intro Client

Setting up a local solana client, initializing a keypair, and calling an on-chain program.

### Installation
To install dependencies, run `npm install`.

### Running the client
To run the client, run `npm start`.

On-running the client, it should generate a new keypair and print the public key. It will then call the `ping` program on-chain, and returns the transaction signature.
