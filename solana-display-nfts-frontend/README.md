## ðŸ“± Displaying NFTs from a wallet & Candy Machine

## Getting Started

What good is an NFT if you canâ€™t show it off! In this application, weâ€™re going to help you shake that money-maker (assuming your NFT is a money-maker) by displaying it in a wallet and then displaying it in the Candy Machine.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Build and Run

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


You can connect your wallet to see your NFTs. You can also view NFTs in a Candy machine by entering the address of it.
