##  NFT your face ðŸ‘¨

What better to make an NFT of than your face? You get to immortalise yourself as an early buildooor and you can tell your mom you're on the blockchain.

In this program we'll be implementing a simple NFT program that allows you to mint your face as an NFT. And we'll update the NFT using Metaplex ```updateNFT``` method.


### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the client

To run the client, run ```npm start```


On-running the client, it should generate a meta data for your NFT and upload it to arweave. You can view the your NFT on solana explorer by using the token mint address.
