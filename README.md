        A Solana program is just a piece of code that lives on the blockchain. The blockchain is a place where anyone can run code for a fee. You can think of the blockchain like AWS or Heroku. But, instead of being run by a big corporation these chains are run by "miners". In the world of Solana we actually call them "validators".

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 align="center"><b>About The Project</b></h2>

We're going to spend a ton of time diving into Solana in this project and you'll have plenty of time to learn about what the heck Solana is by actually building on it. Don't worry — we'll get to a bunch of stuff like how Solana has low gas-fees, how it's really fast, etc. I don't want us to spend a ton of time on theory here. The last thing I want you to do is to go down the blockchain rabbit hole and start watching tons of random YT videos or Wikipedia posts. I think doing that stuff is good, but just finish this project first. Then go down the rabbit hole! I promise all your research will make a ton more sense once you actually ship this project. I do think it's valuable to have a base level understanding of some of the concepts and get a high-level picture of how stuff is working on Solana, though! So, let's do that :).
